# light-biofeedback-effects-on-stress

This project is part of my occupation as a research assistant. We conducted a study about the effects of light induced breathing intervention on stress responses where I was responsible for study management, data management and analysis. The code shared here was written for preparation and execution of the analysis. As the results of the study do not have published yet, no data or graphs can be shared, the code is only to present my coding abilities.
